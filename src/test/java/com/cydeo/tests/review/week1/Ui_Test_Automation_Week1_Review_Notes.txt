UI Test Automation Week1

- Today's schedule:
  - HTML
  - Selenium Intro


---------------------------------------------------------------------


- What is HTML? Can you explain how it works?

 - HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.

 - HTML is used to create certain structure for web applications using markup tags which are used to structure and format content on a web page. These tags are used to create headings, paragraphs, lists, links, tables, images, and other elements of a web page.

 - When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model (DOM) of the page. When we right click and select inspect, we can see DOM of the page.


-----------------------


- What is Selenium?

 - Selenium is an open source project (library) to automate browsers


-------------


- Why are we using Selenium? What are the Advantages of Selenium?

 - Open source --> Free which makes it cost-effective for organizations.
 
 - Supports multiple programming languages Java, Python, C#, Ruby, and JavaScript, offering flexibility for testers.
 
 - Supports multiple OS (Windows, Mac, Linux)
 
 - Supports multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc..)
 
 - It has a major community support behind it


--------------


- What are the Disadvantages of Selenium?

 - Selenium automates Web browsers only, it doesn’t support Computer Desktop Applications.
 
 - Requires technical knowledge to use like programming skills.
 
 - No tech support as it is an open-source. For any issues, one has to rely only on community forums to get your technical issues resolved.
 
 - There is no built-in report coming from Selenium library, requiring third-party tools or plugins for reporting.
 
 - Selenium independently does not support image, captcha testing.


------------------


- SELENIUM METHODS:

 - get(“URL”) : It gets given URL in an opened browser.
 
 - navigate().forward () :  will take page to forward page
 
 - navigate().back() :  will take page to previous page
 
 - navigate().refresh() :  will refresh the current page
 
 - getText(): It will return the text of the provided WebElement as a String
 
 - getAttribute("attributeName"): It will find the matching "attributeName" and return its value as a String.
 
 - close(): It is used to close the current browser window having focus.
 
 - quit():If we have more than one opened window/page it will closed all of them

- What is the difference between http and https?

 - HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol. 
 - HTTPS stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure

 - HTTP is less secure as the data can be vulnerable to hackers.
 - HTTPS is designed to prevent hackers from accessing critical information. It is secure against such attacks.

 - HTTP website doesn’t use encryption.
 - HTTPS websites use data encryption.
